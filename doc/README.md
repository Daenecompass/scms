# Documentation

## Format - Markdown

The documentation herein is either in PDF or MarkDown (md) form.

Where possible, use md format as this is versionable--specifically Github Flavoured Markdown (GFM).

To preview the md, use http://tmpvar.com/markdown.html.

The specifications for GFM MD, refer to: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/

## Graph - DOT

When possible, graphs are to be in DOT language format (www.graphviz.org).

To preview the graph from the markup, use the following free online viewer: http://sandbox.kidstrythisathome.com/erdos/.

For good reading on the specifications of the DOT language: http://www.graphviz.org/pdf/dotguide.pdf

There's a commandline tool available at: http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php
