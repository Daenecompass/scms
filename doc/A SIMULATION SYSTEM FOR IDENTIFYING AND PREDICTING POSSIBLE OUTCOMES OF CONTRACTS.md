# Title

A SIMULATION SYSTEM FOR IDENTIFYING AND PREDICTING POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OF CONTRACTS

-------------
# Summary

An infomation system that simulates a pre-defined set of scenarios of a contract. Said contract is to be firstly formatted as a Smart Contract[1], so that the authoritative version of the contract is drafted in machine interpretable scripting language. In order for this to work--other than the Smart Contract Management System--, there needs to be in place: (i) coding standards, and (ii) a simulation engine.
