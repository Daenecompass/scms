# Smart Contract Management System

## NScrypt
A Smart Contract Management System--doubles as an IDE for Smart Contracts and a CRM for negotiating, signing and processing Smart Contracts.

## Background
Smart Contracts are conceptually not new (see Nick Szabo's work), but have never been integrated into existing systems, nor provided as a proper legal service.

### Definition
**Smart Contract**: (noun) a digital record of a contract or agreement, which (1) contains terms that are machine interpretable and/or machine executable; (2) represents the actual agreement as accepted by signature; and (3) is stored and administered by a third party system.

### More Information
Lots has been written on the subject and on the project, here's a list of documents to get started (in the doc folder):
