## Background
Smart Contracts are conceptually not new (see Nick Szabo's work), but have never been integrated into existing systems, nor provided as a proper legal service.

### Definition
**Smart Contract**: (noun) a digital record of a contract or agreement, which (1) contains terms that are machine interpretable and/or machine executable; (2) represents the actual agreement as accepted by signature; and (3) is stored and administered by a third party system.
